<p>For the Kronecker cases, files .tex, .pdf and .py are computed up to symmetry on the dimension (ex: mod $\mathfrak S_3$ for Kron-5-5-5).</p>
<p>The dominance inequalities are not given in these files. </p>
<p>The number given in the last column corresponds to the number of inequalities in these files. </p>
<br>
<p> The files .in and .out always contain all the inequalities (full orbits under symmetries for Kron INCLUDING the dominance inequalities in all cases). </p>
